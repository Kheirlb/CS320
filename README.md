My personal cloud of class notes and scripts.

Most present lecture at the top.

## Lecture 8/29/18
OS loaded on system...
OS are written in a languages.
Terminal are a shell on top of the OS.
I can run my own bash shells using a scripting language.

Unix Commands
pwd ~ present writing directory (not actually)
ps ~ processes, shows all processes
cat ~ copy at terminal (more also does page view)

VI is the editor Kraft recommends.
Navigation/Editor Modes.

System.out is an object that is an output buffer stream.
c is not an object orientated language...
...this means we have a procedural imperative language...

An object orientated language can have classes... they have data and options performed on that data.
C can't encapsulate anything... very error prone.
Easier to maintain programs.

Java (Java is Cross Platform):
.java
.class
then .exe

Linux has 3 standard streams:
standard in
standard out
standard error

## Lecture 8/27/18
Lost these notes because of Eclipse IDE complication. Very frustrating.
Here's what I remember:

Make sure you opt out of book.
Sign up for Rosie is required.

Don't need the book, but probably best to get it.
Couple different types of programming languages:
- Deterministic vs Imperative
- Procedural vs Function
- Scripts
- R?

Learned about all the different Hello Worlds
